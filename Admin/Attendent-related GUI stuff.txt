Attendent-related GUI stuff:

Stuff that needs to be shown on the Attendent Station Screen/Window:

	- should show Sessions that are "tracked" (remember, one attendent tracks multiple sessions) 
		this could be done with just a list, a set of boxes, or each Session could link to a more detailed view.

	- displays information when a notification is recieved from a Session (eg. Session 1 sends a weight discrepency request)
		this could be done with a popup window. All possible notifications (called "requests") can be found in Attendent.Requests in the attendant-dev branch
	- displays information when an issue prediction is recieved (eg. low paper prediction about Session 1)
		this could also be done with a popup window. The potental notifications can be seen in IssuePredictorListener in the attendant-dev branch

	- some kind of interface for text search
		- this only needs to show up when a Session has requested "add item via text lookup", so this could be a different screen
		- Nick knows more about this, but it should be similer to the visual catalogue but with a textbox for searching
		- when an item in this visual catalogue is "clicked" then the screen should go back to the normal attendant screen

	- Some kind of interface for enable/disabling a given Session
		
	- "maintence" related buttons (refill ink, paper, coins, banknotes and empty coins and banknotes) for a given sesssion

	- when a maintence task causes an error (eg. overflowed ink) then should show some visual indicator (eg. pop up)
		these can be best seen in the use case discreptions
